# GeoFS Spoilers Arming
This is a recreation of Harry Xue's extenstion for [GeoFS](https://www.geo-fs.com/) (a free flight simulator running on browsers), which adds the option to arm spoilers on the approach so they are automatically deployed on touchdown, just like in real life.

Harry Xue's original repo: [https://github.com/gefs-plugins/spoiler-arming](https://github.com/gefs-plugins/spoiler-arming)

## Using the extension:
To add the script to the game, you must have a userscript plugin. Some options include:
- [TamperMonkey](http://tampermonkey.net/) (Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Safari, Opera Next, Dolphin Browser, and Firefox)
- [GreaseMonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) (Firefox)
- [ViolentMonkey](https://addons.opera.com/en/extensions/details/violent-monkey/) (Opera)
 
 After you have installed a userscript plugin, install the script, and you're ready to go!
